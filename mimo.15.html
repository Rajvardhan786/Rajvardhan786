        <h1> future of google # pichai </h1>
         <img src ="C:\Users\Rahul Bhujbal\Pictures\mine craft pics/downloadmc4.jpg" width= "20" height=20">
         <p> Over the past few months, since the appointment of the third chief executive
            officer (CEO) of IT giant Google on 10 August 2015, both the media and
            analysts have been speculating about the changes Sundar Pichai will bring about
            at Google. Needless to say, the kind of expectation that has stemmed from
            Pichai’s appointment is unprecedented, and perhaps surpasses even that of Satya
            Nadella, when he was chosen to lead the world’s fourth-largest company,
            Microsoft, just a year ago.
            Unlike Microsoft and several other large technology companies, Google
            hasn’t made too many mistakes in the past. This is not to say that it has been
            smooth sailing for Google so far, as they have faced fierce competition from
            Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and various other companies on different fronts.
            However, most of Google’s recent product stories have been written right, and
            observers would be hard put to find fault with too many of them. In fact, Pichai’s
            ability to come up with winning products has been something Google’s cofounder Larry Page has lauded in the past. Now that the man behind most of
            those products is actually in the driver’s seat, it will be interesting to see in
            which direction he plans to steer Google. On the flip side, there have been
            people who have criticized Google for going slow on innovation in recent years.
            Larry Page’s decision to create Alphabet as the holding company and focus on
            moon shots through the newly formed entity may actually be a move to counter
            that criticism. It leaves Pichai to focus on making Google better at what it does.
            A leaner Google will also innovate better.
            Sundar Pichai has been at the forefront of most of these developments, and
            with his promotion a lot of people will be keenly watching the developments at
            Google’s Mountain View headquarters in California, USA. Google, under
            Sergey Brin, Eric Schmidt and Larry Page, has made huge strides since its
            beginning in 1998. Will the company lead the world into the next phase oftechnological innovation? More importantly, will Sundar Pichai be the man to
            take the company there?
            Like Nadella, Sundar Pichai has not been much of a public figure in the past.
            Very little is known of the man from Chennai who has rapidly risen through the
            ranks of the tech giant. What goads this man to excel? What does Pichai’s
            appointment portend for Google and, possibly, for the tech industry as a whole?
            In endeavouring to glean answers to these questions and several more, I have
            had the fortune of analysing not just Google but also its latest CEO. By all
            accounts, it appears that Google is set for a very interesting ride and Sundar
            Pichai may end up surprising his supporters and detractors alike.
            Pichai’s appointment as CEO of Google and Larry Page’s transition to
            Alphabet is merely the tip of the iceberg. The actual story of Google’s new
            innings will start unfurling over the following months and will continue for at
            least a couple of years from now. By all accounts, Google appears to be in safe
            hands. However, only time will tell whether Google will supersede its biggest
            rivals or end up losing its current market share to more nimble players. In the
            interim, this book attempts to give an insight into Sundar Pichai, the man and the
            professional, and what his recent promotion means for Google, and for the future </p>
